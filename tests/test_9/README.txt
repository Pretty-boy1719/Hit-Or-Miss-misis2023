The test demonstrates the search for a black rectangle 19*19.

Given:
image - a 200*200 image with black rectangles.
kernel_foreground - a black rectangle of 19*19.
kernel_background - a white frame 21*21.
hit_highlight - a black frame 19*19.

Expected result:
The found black rectangle  will be represented as black frame.

The result may be too big to latex. But it's still in the visualization.tex
